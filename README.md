# üêç Django 24h Challenge üêç

## Commands to start

Depedencies:</br>
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3</br>
pip install django</br>
pip install djangorestframework</br>
pip install django-crispy-forms</br>

django-admin startproject \<nameProject\> *create a new project*</br>
python3 manage.py runserver 8000 *run the server in 127.0.0.1/8000*</br>
python3 manage.py startapp \<nameApp\></br>

## When you want to config your app

adding a function with a render in your nameApp.views</br>
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def mainPage(response):
	return HttpResponse("<h1>Welcome to our site</h1>")
```

adding a urls.py file to the nameApp folder</br>
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
      path('', views.nameApp, name='name'),
]
```
</br>

edit nameProject.urls to add a url for the new app</br>
```python
path('', include('nameApp.urls'))
```
</br>

## Adding models

on your appName folder there is a models.py you can add models for your DB, here Item is part of a Form</br>
```python
from django.db import models

class Form(models.Model0):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=40, unique=True, primary_key=True, default="name")
	description = models.CharField(max_length=512, default="description")

	def __str__(self):
		return self.name

class Item(models.Model):
	form = models.ForeignKey(Form, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

	description = models.CharField(max_length=512, default="description")
	complete = models.BooleanField(default=False)

	def __str__(self):
		return self.description
```
A item_set field will be automatically generated in the Form</br>
After that you need to migrate AND apply those migration for your DB with</br></br>
python3 manage.py makemigrations nameApp</br>
python3 manage.py migrate</br></br>
We have now a fully functionnal data base</br>

## Fill our data base

You can do this with a lor of different ways, with the admin pannel, or with the command lines like this</br></br>
python3 manage.py shell</br>
from main.models import Item, Form</br>
form = Form(name='ShrubberyForm', description='A nice little form who generate nothing')</br>
form.save()</br>
form.item_set.create(description='Do nothing at all.')</br></br>
And that's it, if you want to verufy that your data has been added correctly just do</br></br>
Form.objects.all() OR Form.objects.get(id=1)</br>
form.item_set.all() OR form.item_set.get(id=1)</br>

## Create an API

Simply create a new app called API with 2 specificity</br>
We will be using the rest_framework of django</br>
We first need to have something that convert our class in json format: a serializer</br>
```python
from main.models import Form
from rest_framework import serializers

class FormSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Form
		fields = '__all__'
```
And we have to made one for each class, Form, Item and People.</br>
Now the second very important thing to do, is understand what http requests are</br></br>
There is 4 principal http request, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE</br></br>
GET is to get information from the data base</br>
POST is to create new data in the data base</br>
PUT is to modify/edit existing data in the data base</br>
DELETE is To delete data from the data base</br>
*things are simplified here to be comprehensive*</br></br>
An URL can be called with those request, for instance, if we call http:.../api/form/ with a GET request</br>
that probably mean you want to access data with this address, if you call the SAME url with a DELETE request</br>
that probably mean you want to delete a form.</br>
So we need to do different things on our functions depending on the request, this is waht we get:</br>
```python
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
def homeForm(request):
	if request.method == 'GET':
		forms = Form.objects.all()
		serializer = FormSerializer(forms, many=True)
		return Response(serializer.data)
	elif request.method == 'POST':
		serializer = FormSerializer(data=request.data)
		if serializer.is_valid():
			serializer.save()
			return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)

@api_view(['GET', 'PUT', "DELETE"])
def formDetails(request, id, format=None):
	try:
		selected = Form.objects.get(pk=id)
	except Form.DoesNotExist:
		return Response(status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

	if request.method == 'GET':
		serializer = FormSerializer(selected)
		return Response(serializer.data)
	elif request.method == 'PUT':
		serializer = FormSerializer(selected, data=request.data)
		if serializer.is_valid():
			serializer.save()
			return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
		return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
	elif request.method == 'DELETE':
		selected.delete()
		return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```
Like we can see, we also return HTTP status to know if an operation is well made or not</br>
Some html pages are already generated to display infos of the API so we will just add a home page for </br>
the API in order to access to the different classes accessible by this one.</br>
However in order to do this, we need to learn what templates are with django</br>

## Templates with Django

With django, we can create *templates* html files.</br>
What does that mean ? Like classes on OOP, we can create objects, that can be called in html </br>
pages, to avoid code duplication, we can have variable and that kind of stuff in it to have dynamic</br>
templates we will see how good that is.</br></br>
The synthax is kinda weird but we will have a lot of {% xxx %} tags</br>
To begin with, we have to create on our appName folder a templates folder</br>
In this folder we HAVE TO create another folder which has the same name of our appName</br>
and we will put on it a base.html file</br>
This file exist to give a model of how each page of our site should look like, a structure of it</br>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<style type='text/css'>
			...css code...
		</style>

		...include bootstrap if you want...
		
		<title>{% block title %}Djungo challenge{% endblock %}</title>

		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class='sidenav'>
			<a href='/'>Home</a>
			<a href='/accessForms/'>Access Form</a>
			<a href='/createForm/'>Create Form</a>
			<a href='/api/'>API</a>
			<a href='/admin/'>Admin Pannel</a>
			{% if user.is_authenticated %}
				<a href='/logout/'>Logout</a>
			{% else %}
				<a href='/login/'>Login</a>
			{% endif %}
		</div>

		<div id='content', name='content', class='main'>
			<div class='row justify-content-center'>
				<div class='col-8'>
					<h1 class='mt-2'>QuickForm Website</h1>
					<hr class='mt-0 mb-4'>
					{% block content %}
					{% endblock %}
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```
This look like a classic html page however, we have some weird stuff in it</br>
There is a {% block title %} a {% block content %} or even a {% if user.is_authenticated %}</br>
This is exactly what make templates dynamicly filled. That mean that in every html file we will</br>
just have to include this template file, and everything on this page will be copied. After this we need to</br>
fill those 2 content and title block with the data we ant, and it's done!</br>
This is how a html file with this template include should look like:</br>
```html
{% extends 'appName/base.html' %}

{% block title %}
	Access Form
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	<h3>Access Form</h3>
	</br>
	{% for form in forms %}
		<div>
			<a href='/{{form.id}}'> {{form.name}} </a></br>
		</div>
	{% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```
We can see the extends statement which allows us to include the template file</br>
After this we just have to put content between the block tags and the text will be displayed</br>
If you look closely, you'll see some '{{form.name}}' element for exemple</br>
This is simply because we can give variable to our html file to make things dynamic</br>
How to give variable to our file ?</br>
```python
def accessForms(request):
	forms = Form.objects.all()
	return render(request, 'main/accessForms.html', {'forms':forms})
```
Like we can see here we can give dictionary in parameter of the render function inside our views.py</br></br>
Last but not list, with those {% ... %} tags, we can write python code in our html page</br>
that mean we can use if, else, for or any other python statement</br>

## Authentication protocol

Because we want this website to be a lil bit secured and 'user friendly' we will</br>
create really simple authenticate system</br>
Lucky us, if django is famous, is because it has some module which allow us to do that easier</br>
Django even give us the form for authentication so we don't have to do it by ourself</br>
In order to use them, we just have to import the component, 
```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

def register(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
		if form.is_valid():
			form.save()
		return redirect('/login/')
	else:
		form = UserCreationForm()
	return render(request, 'register/register.html', {'form':form})
```
We can now register, but we still have an issue, DJango gives us html page to login, logout... etc</br>
However, they don't already exists</br>
We have to create in our templates folder a registration folder and in it create a login.html file</br>
which will be recognized by Django</br>
```html
{% extends 'main/base.html' %}

{% block title %}
	Login on QuickForm
{% endblock %}

{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

{% block content %}
	<form method='POST' class='form-group'>
		{% csrf_token %}
		{{ form|crispy }}
		<button type='submit' class='btn btn-success'>Login</button>
		<p>Don't have an account? Create one <a href='/register'>here</a></p>
	</form>
{% endblock %}
```
Here we're using the crispy framework, which is a Django framework to make better looking forms</br>
There is also the use of bootstrap framework on our html files</br>
